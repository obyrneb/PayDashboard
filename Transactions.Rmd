This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)

# Read data and create pay dataframe
pay.df <- read_xlsx("datasets//dashboard_data.xlsx")

# Remove line breay from date, add day (the 15th) and transfrom into a date object
pay.df$Month <- gsub("\r?\n|\r", " ", pay.df$Month)
pay.df$Month <- as.Date(paste0("15 ", pay.df$Month), "%d %B %Y")

# Select columns and create Efficiency column (Processed transactions / Staff)
pay.df <- pay.df %>%
  select(Month, Backlog, Received, Processed, Staff) %>%
  mutate(Efficiency = Processed / Staff)

# Create a graph of transactions processed by month.
# Add a dashed line indicating the "regular workload" of 80,000 cases per month
plot1 <- ggplot(pay.df, aes(x = Month, y = Processed, group = Processed)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,NA), expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0,.15))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b\n%Y") +

  geom_text(vjust = -0.2, aes(y = Processed, label = round(Processed,0))) +
  geom_line(aes(group=1))

# Create a graph of staff levels per month.
# Values are not available for every month.
# Some have been imputed using a simple linear function.
plot2 <- ggplot(pay.df, aes(x = Month, y = Staff, group = Staff)) +

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
# Create a scatterplot graphing processed vs received transactions.
# Why do we tend to see more transactions processed when more are received?
plot4 <- ggplot(pay.df, aes(x = Received, y = Processed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

res <- cor.test(pay.df$Received, pay.df$Processed, 
                    method = "pearson")
res

plot4
```
